# AI Usage Report (AI_REPORT)

- Student Name: Димаш
- Course/Lab: Lab 02 (Week 2)
- Date: 2026-01-24

## Summary of AI Assistance
- Purpose: Implement Lab 2.1 (Fragments & List Mapping) and Lab 2.2 (Custom JSX Elements & Dynamic Props) per the assignment in `lab2.md`.
- Scope: Scaffolding two React (Vite) projects, implementing required components, adding READMEs, updating `lab2.md` with run instructions and file links, building to verify.

## Tools/Models
- Model: GPT-5
- Environment: VS Code with PowerShell on Windows, Node.js v22.15.1, npm 10.9.2.

## Prompts and Guidance Provided to AI
- Initial request: "сделай задание lab2.md".
- Follow-up: AI policy and publishing request — "AI Политика: ... обязателен AI_REPORT ... и запушь https://github.com/BDaaac/frontend".

## AI-Generated Artifacts
- Created project folders: `Lab_02/task1` and `Lab_02/task2`.
- Implemented components:
  - Lab 2.1: `FragmentLayout`, `ItemList`, `CombinedList`, with fragment-only grouping and list mapping.
  - Lab 2.2: `Card`, `ProductList`, `Section`, with dynamic props and fragment-based composition.
- Added READMEs detailing run instructions and component overview.
- Updated `lab2.md` with implementation notes and run instructions.

## Human Oversight & Validation
- Build verification: Ran `vite build` for both projects successfully; no compile errors.
- Next steps: Run `npm run dev` to manually verify UI and DevTools structure (no extra wrappers).

## Limitations & Considerations
- Student Name/ID may need confirmation; please fill Student ID above.
- Repo structure expectations: Content added under `Lab_02/`; if the target repo requires a different layout, adjust paths.
- Security: No secrets added; `node_modules` and `dist` will be git-ignored to avoid bloat.

## Ethical Use
- AI assistance used for scaffolding and code generation aligned with assignment requirements.
- Human remains responsible for reviewing, understanding, and presenting the work.
